## Overview
This project is a fully functional and responsive website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main goal was to develop a responsive site with minimal custom CSS, leveraging Bootstrap for the majority of the styling and layout.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive across a wide range of devices.
- **Minimal Custom CSS**: Only a few custom CSS rules were added to adjust small things like font sizes. All structural and responsive elements are styled using Bootstrap.
- **Bootstrap Components**: The site makes extensive use of Bootstrap components such as cards, carousels, hamburger menu, grid system, and flexbox to achieve a modern and cohesive design.

## Pages
The website consists of three pages:
1. **Home**: Features multiple carousels and several sections using Bootstrap cards.
2. **Courses**: This section just contains a videos section and a form for filtering.
3. **Pricing**: This page has a grid layout for pricing guide and F.A.Q. section.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Minimal custom CSS for font sizes.
- **Bootstrap**: Used extensively for styling, layout, and responsive design.
